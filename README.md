# RutgersProfs
This project automates the extraction of data from RateMyProfessors.com, providing a RESTful API to query information on over 6,500 professors. Leveraging headless Selenium for efficient data scraping and OpenAI's language model for processing natural language queries, this system offers a responsive web interface built with React for users to interact with the data.
